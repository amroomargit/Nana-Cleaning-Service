<p>This website was built on 140+ commits (GitHub only lists 79 because I switched between private and public multiple times) and over 100+ hours (why it took this long is explained below under the [lessons
  learned header](#LessonsLearned)).</p>

# LessonsLearned
<p>This was my first time ever working frontend, prior to this, I had never touched HTML, CSS, JS, Azure, or ANY of the technologies mentioned. I fell into many, many potholes working on this and spent hours researching how to solve the issues.</p>
