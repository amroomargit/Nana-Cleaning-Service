<p>This website was built on 140+ commits (GitHub only lists 79 because I switched between private and public multiple times) and over 120+ hours <strong>(why it took this long is explained below under the lessons learned header).</strong></p>

<h1>Lessons Learned: </h1>
<p><strong>This was my first time ever working frontend, prior to this, I had never touched HTML, CSS, JS, Azure, or ANY of the technologies mentioned. </strong>I fell into many, many potholes working on this and spent hours researching how to solve the issues.</p>
